Hello, I'm Michael Vincent Calma. As a working student, life can get crazy. But I've found my balance with skateboarding, playing guitar, but i use most of my free time to rest😅. It's not always easy, but I'm learning to prioritize what matters, Just taking life one day at a time💯.

### What i Believe in 🤔
- Believe you can and you're halfway there!
- It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop
- The unexamined life is not worth living
